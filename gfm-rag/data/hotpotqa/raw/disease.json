Typically presenting in early life, IAHSP is marked by severe spasticity of the lower limbs, which progresses to involve the upper limbs by late childhood. Affected individuals also exhibit dysarthria and other signs of bulbar dysfunction, such as dysphagia and slow eye movements. As the disease advances, patients often become wheelchair-bound and may experience feeding difficulties, pseudobulbar syndrome, and ultimately, severe spastic tetraparesis. Notably, cognitive function is generally preserved throughout the course of the illness. With no specific treatment available, management primarily focuses on physical and occupational therapy to promote mobility and independence. The prevalence of IAHSP is estimated to be less than 1 in 1 million, with only a handful of reported cases worldwide, highlighting its extraordinary rarity and the need for further research into this devastating condition.",
  "Infantile-onset Ascending Hereditary Spastic Paralysis (IAHSP)": "Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP) is a rare motor neuron disease characterized by severe spasticity of the lower limbs in early life, which progresses to the upper limbs in late childhood. Typically, affected patients are normal at birth and exhibit unremarkable early development. However, they then develop spastic paraplegia, increased reflexes, and sustained lower limb stiffness in the first two years of life. By around 7-8 years of age, progressive weakness and spasticity extend to the upper limbs, accompanied by dysarthria, dysphagia (sometimes with drooling), and slow eye movements. As the disease progresses, most patients become wheelchair-bound by late childhood or early adolescence, and some may experience feeding difficulties starting in the second decade. Subsequently, the condition can lead to severe spastic tetraparesis and pseudobulbar syndrome manifestations. Cognitive function is generally preserved throughout the course of the disease. Management primarily involves physical and occupational therapy to promote mobility and independence, although no specific treatment is currently available.

The most common causes of allergic seminal vaginitis include bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, trichomoniasis, and non-infectious vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis results from an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the vagina, often linked to sexual intercourse or hormonal changes. Yeast infections occur when there is an overgrowth of fungal organisms, such as Candida albicans, which can also cause infections in other moist areas of the body. Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, which increases the risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections. Non-infectious vaginitis may result from allergic reactions to vaginal sprays, douches, or spermicidal products, as well as foreign objects left in the vagina.\n\nRisk factors for developing allergic seminal vaginitis include hormonal changes, sexual activity, having a sexually transmitted infection, medications such as antibiotics and steroids, use of spermicides, uncontrolled diabetes, and the use of hygiene products like bubble bath or vaginal deodorant. Women with trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis are at a greater risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections due to inflammation caused by these disorders. Pregnant women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis may experience premature deliveries and low birth weight babies.\n\nGood hygiene practices can help prevent some types of vaginitis from recurring and relieve symptoms. Women should avoid baths, hot tubs, and whirlpool spas, as well as irritants like scented tampons, pads, douches, and soaps. They should also rinse soap from their outer genital area after showering and dry the area well to prevent irritation. Wearing cotton underwear and using a latex condom may also help prevent vaginitis.\n\nWomen should seek medical attention if they experience unusual vaginal discomfort, especially if they have an unpleasant vaginal odor, discharge, or itching. They should also see their doctor if they've never had a vaginal infection, have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner, or have completed a course of over-the-counter anti-yeast medication and their symptoms persist.",

  "Hamartomatous Lip Lesion": "Hamartomatous lip lesions, also known as lipofibromatous hamartoma, are rare benign tumors that occur in the oral mucosa, typically affecting the lower lip. These growths arise from an abnormal proliferation of normal tissue elements, resulting in a disorganized collection of mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Clinically, they present as solitary, painless, and slow-growing lesions that may appear nodular or papillomatous, often measuring up to several centimeters in diameter. The majority of cases are diagnosed in the first three decades of life, with no gender predisposition. Histopathologically, hamartomatous lip lesions exhibit a characteristic mixture of fibrous tissue, fatty cells, and epithelial elements, which can be differentiated from other benign or malignant oral lesions by their distinct morphology. Management typically involves surgical excision, as these lesions do not recur after complete removal. Although rare, hamartomatous lip lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unusual oral lesions, particularly those presenting with a slow growth rate and absence of pain.",

  "portal hypertension, noncirrhotic": "Name: Portal Hypertension, Noncirrhotic\n\nDescription: Portal hypertension, noncirrhotic, is a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in pressure within the portal vein system, which drains blood from the digestive organs into the liver. This elevated pressure can lead to various complications, including esophageal varices, splenomegaly, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The term \"noncirrhotic\" distinguishes this condition from cirrhotic portal hypertension, which is associated with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.\n\nThe etiology of noncirrhotic portal hypertension can be attributed to several factors, including:\n\n1. Congenital anomalies: Some individuals are born with abnormalities in the structure or function of the portal vein system, leading to increased pressure within the vessels.\n2. Inflammatory conditions: Chronic inflammation in the digestive organs or liver can cause dilatation of the portal veins and increased pressure within the system.\n3. Malignancies: Cancerous tumors in the digestive organs or liver can obstruct the flow of blood through the portal vein system, leading to hypertension.\n4. Obesity: Excess body weight can increase pressure within the portal veins due to the increased blood volume and cardiac output required to meet metabolic demands.\n5. Genetic factors: Some individuals may have inherited genetic mutations that predispose them to develop noncirrhotic portal hypertension.\n\nThe clinical presentation of noncirrhotic portal hypertension can vary depending on the severity of the hypertension and the presence of complications. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Abdominal pain or discomfort\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Fatigue\n* Weight loss\n* Bleeding episodes (gastrointestinal or esophageal)\n\nDiagnosis of noncirrhotic portal hypertension typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Laboratory tests may include liver function tests, complete blood counts, and serum biochemistry analysis to evaluate liver function, hemoglobin levels, and renal function. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be employed to visualize the portal vein system and detect any abnormalities, including esophageal varices or splenomegaly.\n\nTreatment of noncirrhotic portal hypertension typically involves a combination of pharmacological and endoscopic therapies. Pharmacological interventions may include beta blockers, nitrates, and antibiotics to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Endoscopic therapies, such as variceal ligation or sclerotherapy, may be employed to obliterate esophageal varices and prevent bleeding episodes.

  "Familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly": "Familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the association of arthropathy (joint deformity and painful osteoarthritis) of interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints with brachydactyly (shortening of the middle and distal phalanges) of the fingers and toes. This condition typically becomes apparent during the first decade of life and affects numerous members from five generations of one large family in an autosomal dominant manner. The disorder is caused by mutations in the TRPV4 gene, which encodes a transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4. This channel plays a role in the regulation of pain and inflammation, and mutations in this gene have been linked to other neurological disorders.\n\nThe clinical presentation of familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly typically includes joint deformity, pain, and limited mobility in the affected joints. The degree of joint deformity can vary widely among individuals, with some experiencing mild symptoms while others may have more severe impairments. Brachydactyly is also a prominent feature of the disorder, with shortening of the middle and distal phalanges affecting both hands and feet.\n\nEpidemiologically, familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly is a rare disorder, with only a few reported cases in the medical literature. However, its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern suggests that it may be more common than currently recognized, and further research is needed to determine the true prevalence of this condition.\n\nManagement of familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy, bracing, and pain management. In some cases, surgical interventions such as joint replacement or osteotomy may be necessary to improve joint function and reduce pain. Genetic counseling and testing can also be useful in identifying individuals who are at risk of inheriting the mutated TRPV4 gene responsible for this disorder.\n\nIn conclusion, familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the association of joint deformity and brachydactyly with autosomal dominant inheritance. While the condition is typically recognized in childhood or adolescence, its impact on quality of life can be significant. A comprehensive management plan that includes physical therapy, bracing, pain management, and genetic counseling can help improve outcomes for individuals affected by this disorder.",

  "Ataxia Telangiectasia": "Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare, progressive childhood disease that causes degeneration in the brain and other body systems. It is characterized by neurological signs, telangiectasias, increased susceptibility to infections and a higher risk of cancer. The disease affects various organs, including the brain, immune system, and lymphoreticular tissues. Telangiectasia is the formation of tiny red \"spider\" veins that might appear in the corners of the eyes or on the ears and cheeks. Delayed motor skill development, poor balance, and slurred speech are typically the first indications of the disease. Recurrent sinus and respiratory infections are common. Children with ataxia-telangiectasia are at high risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia or lymphoma. Most people with the disease need a wheelchair by their teens and die before age 30, usually of cancer or lung disease.\n\nManagement and Treatment: Management is symptomatic and involves physiotherapy, speech therapy, and treatment of the infection and pulmonary complications. Beta-blockers may reduce trembling and improve performance of fine movements. As the cells of A-T patients show an increased susceptibility to X-rays, radiotherapy, together with some forms of chemotherapy, should be used with caution. Affected children often require a wheelchair by the age of 10-11.\n\nSymptoms: Ataxia can develop over time or come on suddenly. A sign of a number of neurological disorders, ataxia can cause: Poor coordination, Unsteady walk and a tendency to stumble, Difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt, Change in speech, Involuntary back-and-forth eye movements, Difficulty swallowing.\n\nCauses: Damage, degeneration or loss of nerve cells in the part of your brain that controls muscle coordination, results in ataxia. Your cerebellum comprises two portions of folded tissue situated at the base of your brain near your brainstem. This area of the brain helps with balance as well as eye movements, swallowing and speech. Diseases that damage the spinal cord and peripheral nerves that connect your cerebellum to your muscles also can cause ataxia. Ataxia causes include: Head trauma. Damage to your brain or spinal cord from a blow to your head, such as might occur in a car accident, can cause acute cerebellar ataxia, which comes on suddenly. Stroke. Either a blockage or bleeding in the brain can cause ataxia. When the blood supply to a part of your brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, brain cells die. Cerebral palsy. This is a general term for a group of disorders caused by damage to a child's brain during early development — before, during or shortly after birth — that affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements. Autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions can cause ataxia. Infections. Ataxia can be an uncommon complication of chickenpox and other viral infections such as HIV and Lyme disease. It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. Normally, the ataxia resolves over time. Also, some medications you take can cause problems as you age, so you might need to reduce your dose or discontinue the medication. Alcohol and drug intoxication; heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury; and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia., Vitamin B-6 toxicity also may cause ataxia. These causes are important to identify because the effects are often reversible. Also, some medications you take can cause problems as you age, so you might need to reduce your dose or discontinue the medication. Hereditary ataxias, Some types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are hereditary. If you have one of these conditions, you were born with a defect in a certain gene that makes abnormal proteins. The abnormal proteins hamper the function of nerve cells, primarily in your cerebellum and spinal cord, and cause them to degenerate. As the disease progresses, coordination problems worsen. You can inherit a genetic ataxia from either a dominant gene from one parent or a recessive gene from each parent . In the latter case, it's possible neither parent has the disorder, so there might be no obvious family history. Different gene defects cause different types of ataxia, most of which are progressive. Each type causes poor coordination, but each has specific signs and symptoms. Autosomal dominant ataxias, These include: Spinocerebellar ataxias. Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, but other signs and symptoms, as well as age of onset, differ depending on the specific gene mutation. Episodic ataxia . This rare type of ataxia is caused by a defect in the SGCE gene on chromosome 1. It usually appears in childhood and can progress slowly., Congenital cerebellar ataxia. This rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder is caused by a mutation in the ATXI gene. It typically becomes apparent during early childhood.\n\nWhen to See Doctor: If you aren't aware of having a condition that causes ataxia, such as multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease or other autoimmune conditions, heavy metal poisoning, solvent poisoning, or vitamin B-6 toxicity, see your doctor as soon as possible if you: Lose balance, Unsteady walk and a tendency to stumble, Difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt, Change in speech, Involuntary back-and-forth eye movements, Difficulty swallowing.",

It is marked by neurological signs, telangiectasias, increased susceptibility to infections and a higher risk of cancer. The disease affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. Symptoms appear in young children, usually before age 5, and include ataxia, poor balance, slurred speech, tiny red spider veins on the skin and eyes, lung infections, delayed physical and sexual development, and an increased risk of developing diabetes and cancers, especially lymphoma and leukemia. Although it affects the brain, people with ataxia-telangiectasia usually have normal or high intelligence. Treatment might improve some symptoms, including injections to strengthen the immune system and physical and speech therapy. The disease has no cure, and people with ataxia-telangiectasia typically die before age 30, usually of cancer or lung disease.\n\nIncidence: 1-9/1000000\n\nEpidemiology: Average prevalence is estimated at 1/100000 children.\n\nCauses: Damage, degeneration, or loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination, results in ataxia. The cerebellum consists of two folded tissues situated near the base of the brain. This area helps with balance, eye movements, swallowing, and speech. Diseases that damage the spinal cord and peripheral nerves that connect the cerebellum to muscles can also cause ataxia. Autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease, and other autoimmune conditions can cause ataxia. Infections such as chickenpox and Lyme disease can also cause ataxia, especially during the healing stages.\n\nSymptoms: Ataxia can develop over time or come on suddenly, depending on the underlying cause. Symptoms include poor coordination, unsteady walk, difficulty with fine motor tasks, slurred speech, and an increased risk of developing diabetes and cancers.\n\nManagement and Treatment: Management is symptomatic and involves physiotherapy, speech therapy, and treatment of the infection and pulmonary complications. Beta-blockers may reduce trembling and improve performance of fine movements. People with ataxia-telangiectasia often require a wheelchair by their teens, and the disease usually leads to death before age 30, mostly from cancer or lung disease.\n\nIn conclusion, ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare and inherited disease characterized by severe combined immunodeficiency and progressive cerebellar ataxia. It affects various body systems, including the nervous system, immune system, and other organs. Early identification and treatment can improve quality of life and survival.",
  "Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome": "Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital primary skeletal dysplasia characterized by small stature, bowing of the long bones, camptodactyly, hyperthermic episodes, respiratory distress/apneic episodes and feeding difficulties that usually lead to early mortality. The condition is fatal in most cases as a result of respiratory distress or hyperthermia, but survival beyond one year has been reported in few cases with severe spinal deformities, streaky osteoporosis, and spontaneous fractures. The clinical presentation includes mask-like face, pursed mouth, hypoplastic midface, osteopenia, congenital contractures, muscular hypotonia, and delayed motor development. Management is symptomatic and includes prevention of lung aspirations and choking while eating, physiotherapy and/or surgery for bone malformations, eyes protection from damage to prevent visual loss, and osteopenia or osteoporosis treatment. Predisposition to hyperthermia necessitates caution during procedures requiring anesthesia. SWS is a rare syndrome with few cases reported to date, but it appears to be relatively common in the United Arab Emirates, possibly due to a high number of consanguineous unions.\n\nThe disease is characterized by small stature, bowing of the long bones, camptodactyly, hyperthermic episodes, respiratory distress/apneic episodes and feeding difficulties that usually lead to early mortality. The clinical presentation includes mask-like face, pursed mouth, hypoplastic midface, osteopenia, congenital contractures, muscular hypotonia, and delayed motor development.\n\nSWS is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the FGD1 gene, which codes for the fibulin-1 protein, a key component of the extracellular matrix that provides structural support to connective tissue. The mutation leads to a defect in the formation and maintenance of the bone structure, resulting in the characteristic skeletal abnormalities seen in SWS patients.\n\nThe prognosis for SWS is poor, with most patients dying before the age of one due to respiratory distress or hyperthermia. However, some patients have been reported to survive beyond one year, with severe spinal deformities, streaky osteoporosis, and spontaneous fractures. The management of SWS is symptomatic and includes prevention of lung aspirations and choking while eating, physiotherapy and/or surgery for bone malformations, eyes protection from damage to prevent visual loss, and osteopenia or osteoporosis treatment. Predisposition to hyperthermia necessitates caution during procedures requiring anesthesia.\n\nThe exact prevalence of SWS is unknown, but it appears to be relatively common in the United Arab Emirates, possibly due to a high number of consanguineous unions. The syndrome is rare worldwide, with only a few cases reported in the medical literature.\n\nIn conclusion, Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome is a rare and severe genetic disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and poor prognosis.

  "Muscular dystrophy, progressive Pectorodorsal": "Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. The primary symptom is muscle weakness that worsens over time, affecting various parts of the body. The disease is often diagnosed in early childhood or adolescence, although some types may not manifest until later in life. Muscular dystrophy can be classified into different subtypes based on age of onset, muscle groups affected, and clinical features. The most common form, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, affects boys almost exclusively and is characterized by a lack of the protein dystrophin, which leads to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Other subtypes include Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, Congenital muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and others.\n\nThe causes of muscular dystrophy are genetic mutations that affect the production or structure of proteins essential for muscle function. These mutations can be inherited from parents or occur spontaneously. The risk of developing muscular dystrophy increases if there is a family history of the disease, and it can affect individuals of any age, gender, or ethnicity.\n\nThe complications of muscular dystrophy include difficulty walking, using arms, and performing daily activities due to progressive muscle weakness. Contractures can occur, limiting mobility, and breathing problems can develop as the muscles involved in respiration are affected. Curved spine, heart problems, swallowing difficulties, and feeding tubes may also occur. Early detection and management of muscular dystrophy can help slow disease progression and improve quality of life for affected individuals.\n\nIf you notice signs of muscle weakness in yourself or your child, such as increased clumsiness and falling, seek medical advice from a healthcare professional.

  "Azotemia, Familial": "Familial azotemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of urea in the bloodstream due to defective kidney function. The disease is caused by mutations in the UMOD gene, which codes for the uromodulin protein produced by the kidneys. This protein plays a crucial role in the excretion of urea through the urine. As a result of the mutation, the body is unable to remove excess urea, leading to its buildup in the bloodstream and causing a range of symptoms.\n\nThe clinical presentation of familial azotemia typically begins in childhood or adolescence with signs of kidney dysfunction, such as proteinuria, hematuria, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). As the disease progresses, patients may experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue. If left untreated, the accumulation of urea in the blood can lead to complications such as seizures, confusion, and coma.\n\nEpidemiologically, familial azotemia is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000 individuals worldwide. The disorder affects both males and females equally, and there is no known racial or ethnic predilection. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\nManagement of familial azotemia primarily focuses on slowing the progression of the disease and managing its symptoms. Medications such as bumetanide and furosemide can help reduce fluid buildup in the body, while diuretics may be used to increase urine production. In severe cases, hemodialysis may be necessary to remove excess urea from the bloodstream. Kidney transplantation is also a potential treatment option for advanced cases of the disease.\n\nIn conclusion, familial azotemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of urea in the blood due to defective kidney function.

  "Quebec platelet disorder": "Quebec platelet syndrome (QPS) is a rare and severe bleeding disorder characterized by moderate to severe bleeding after trauma, surgery or obstetric interventions, frequent ecchymoses, mucocutaneous bleeding, and muscle and joint bleeds. The disorder is caused by a deficiency in platelet granules, which are essential for blood clotting and hemostasis. The lack of these granules leads to impaired platelet function, resulting in an increased risk of bleeding episodes. QPS typically affects adults, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1, and often presents with mild symptoms at first, making it challenging to diagnose. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. The prevalence of QPS is estimated to be 1 in 500,000 individuals worldwide.\n\nThe clinical presentation of QPS varies depending on the severity of the disorder. Patients may experience spontaneous bleeding, ecchymoses, and mucocutaneous bleeding, as well as bruising and joint bleeds after trauma or surgery. The bleeding episodes can be severe and may lead to anemia, hypovolemia, and hemorrhagic shock. In some cases, QPS may present with a milder clinical course, characterized by recurrent ecchymoses and bruising without significant bleeding episodes.\n\nThe etiology of QPS is attributed to mutations in the GP1A gene, which codes for the platelet granule-specific glycoprotein Ia (GPIa). These mutations result in the deficiency of GPIa, leading to impaired platelet function. The inheritance pattern of QPS is autosomal dominant, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\nThe diagnosis of QPS is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and genetic analysis. Laboratory tests may include platelet counts, platelet function tests, and genetic analysis to identify the presence of mutations in the GP1A gene. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), may also be used to evaluate the extent of bleeding and identify any associated injuries.\n\nTreatment for QPS typically involves managing bleeding episodes with blood transfusions, vitamin K therapy, and platelet infusions. In some cases, medications such as aspirin or clopidogrel may be prescribed to reduce the risk of bleeding. Surgical interventions may also be necessary to repair damaged blood vessels or to remove blood clots.\n\nIn conclusion, Quebec platelet disorder is a rare and severe bleeding disorder characterized by moderate to severe bleeding after trauma, surgery or obstetric interventions, frequent ecchymoses, mucocutaneous bleeding, and muscle and joint bleeds. The disorder is caused by mutations in the GP1A gene, which codes for the platelet granule-specific glycoprotein Ia (GPIa).

  "Testicular Anomalies with or without Congenital Heart Disease": "Disease Name: Testicular Anomalies with or without Congenital Heart Disease\n\nMONDO ID: 14239\n\nSymptoms: Heart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have. Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels, A buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries or atherosclerosis can damage your blood vessels and heart. Plaque buildup causes narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain or stroke. Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other signs and symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, numbness, weakness, or coldness in the legs or arms. Signs and symptoms can include: Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure, and chest discomfort, Shortness of breath, Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed, Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back.\n\nCauses: Heart disease causes depend on your specific type of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease. To understand the causes of heart disease, it helps to understand how the heart works. How the heart works, Your heart is a pump. It's a muscular organ about the size of your fist, located slightly left of center in your chest. Your heart is divided into the right and the left sides. The right side of the heart includes the right atrium and ventricle. It collects and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries. The lungs give the blood a new supply of oxygen. The lungs also breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste product. Oxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, including the left atrium and ventricle. The left side of the heart pumps blood through the largest artery in the body to supply tissues throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients. Heart valves, Four heart valves keep your blood moving the right way by opening only one way and only when they need to. To work properly, the valves must be formed properly, must open all the way and must close tightly so there's no leakage. The four valves are: Tricuspid, Mitral, Pulmonary, Aortic, Heartbeats, A beating heart squeezes and relaxes in a continuous cycle. During contraction, your ventricles squeeze tight, forcing blood into the vessels to your lungs and body. During relaxation, the ventricles are filled with blood coming from the upper chambers . Electrical system, Your heart's electrical wiring keeps it beating. Your heartbeat controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. Causes of heart disease include: High blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, stress, and a family history of heart disease.\n\nPrevention: Certain types of heart disease can be prevented or managed with lifestyle changes and medication. These include:\n\n* High blood pressure: Monitor your blood pressure regularly and take medication if it's too high.\n* Smoking: Quit smoking or using other tobacco products.\n* High cholesterol: Eat a healthy diet low in saturated fats and trans fats, and take medication if necessary.\n* Diabetes: Manage your blood sugar levels through a healthy diet and medication.\n* Obesity: Maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.\n* Physical inactivity: Regular exercise can help you manage stress, improve sleep quality, and reduce the risk of heart disease.\n* Stress: Practice stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n* Family history of heart disease: Talk to your doctor about your family medical history and any steps you can take to reduce your risk of heart disease.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor: If you experience any symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, see a doctor right away. Early detection and treatment of heart disease can help prevent complications and improve outcomes. Even if you don't have symptoms, it's important to see a doctor for regular check-ups to monitor your heart health.",

Other abnormalities include recurrent respiratory tract infections, abnormal deep voice, hearing loss, joint laxity, short stature, early loss of permanent teeth, and hirsutism in adults. Some patients may present with congenital heart disease, respiratory, renal, and digestive tract malformations, and umbilical hernia in the first months of life. No treatment exists for AOD, but early osteoporosis might be treated by bisphosphonates, alone or in combination with teriparatide. Prognosis is poor due to progressive bone loss and associated complications.\n\nIncidence and Prevalence: The incidence of AOD is unknown, as it is a rare genetic disorder. However, over 80 cases have been described in the medical literature to date. The prevalence is estimated to be less than 1/100,000.\n\nEtiology and Pathophysiology: The etiology of AOD is complex and multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Mutations in the P3H1 gene on chromosome 7q31.2 have been identified as the primary cause of AOD. These mutations lead to a deficiency of the enzyme pyrophosphate (PPi) nucleotidase, which plays a crucial role in the bone metabolism. The lack of PPi nucleotidase activity results in an imbalance in the bone remodeling process, leading to excessive bone resorption and a high risk of fractures. Additionally, exposure to vinyl chloride, a known environmental toxin, can cause acquired AOD.\n\nClinical Features: The clinical features of AOD are varied and can affect multiple systems. The most common manifestations include acroosteolysis of distal phalanges and generalized osteoporosis. Other characteristics may include craniofacial dysmorphism, dental anomalies, recurrent respiratory tract infections, abnormal deep voice, hearing loss, joint laxity, short stature, early loss of permanent teeth, hirsutism in adults, and congenital heart disease. Some patients may present with umbilical hernia in the first months of life.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis: The differential diagnosis for AOD includes other genetic disorders that present with bone dysplasias or osteoporosis, such as multiple hereditary exostoses, Larsen syndrome, and diaphyseal dysplasia. Acquired forms of osteolysis can be caused by exposure to vinyl chloride or other environmental toxins.\n\nPrognosis: The prognosis for AOD is poor due to progressive bone loss and associated complications. Early intervention with bisphosphonates may improve bone density, but the condition is generally degenerative and leads to significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nManagement and Treatment: There is currently no treatment available for AOD, but early osteoporosis management with bisphosphonates might be beneficial. Teriparatide, a parathyroid hormone-related peptide, has been used in some cases to improve bone density.\n\nIn conclusion, Acroosteolysis Dominant Type (AOD) is a rare genetic osteolysis syndrome characterized by acroosteolysis of distal phalanges and generalized osteoporosis, associated with additional ossification anomalies, craniofacial dysmorphism, dental anomalies, and a wide range of other characteristics. The clinical spectrum is variable and evolves over time, presenting in infancy or early childhood with mild craniofacial dysmorphism and progressive acroosteolysis of distal phalanges and short and broad digits. No treatment exists for AOD, but early osteoporosis management with bisphosphonates might be beneficial. Prognosis is poor due to progressive bone loss and associated complications. Further research is needed to understand the genetic basis of AOD and to develop effective treatments for this rare and debilitating condition.",

The disease is characterized by loss of central vision, the accumulation of drusen in the macula, and atrophy of photoreceptor cells. The phenotype can vary at macular examination, with some patients presenting with mild to severe vision loss, while others may have a more variable or atypical presentation. The etiology of NCMD is attributed to mutations in the DNase1 hypersensitivity site dhs6s1 gene, which is located on chromosome 1q42.\n\nNCMD has an estimated prevalence of less than 1/1000000 individuals worldwide. The disease affects both males and females equally, with no known predilection for any particular ethnic or racial group. The age of onset can range from congenital to early childhood, with the majority of cases presenting in the first few years of life.\n\nClinically, NCMD is characterized by a gradual loss of central vision, typically starting in the early years of life. The rate of progression can vary widely between individuals, with some patients experiencing rapid decline while others may remain stable for many years. The macula is typically affected, leading to a loss of central visual acuity and distortion or blindness in the center of the visual field. Drusen, which are small, round deposits of lipofuscin in the retina, are also commonly present in NCMD patients. These drusen can be identified on fundus examination using a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope or slit-lamp biomicroscopy.\n\nManagement of NCMD typically involves a combination of medical and surgical interventions. In some cases, visual acuity may be improved through the use of corrective glasses or contact lenses. Vitrectomy, a surgical procedure that involves removing the vitreous gel and replacing it with a clear fluid, can also be effective in improving vision in advanced cases of NCMD.

  "Gilbert syndrome": "Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, resulting in harmless intermittent jaundice. This benign familial disorder is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and is caused by an abnormal gene that controls the enzyme responsible for breaking down bilirubin in the liver. As a result of this defect, bilirubin levels may increase and jaundice may become apparent due to various factors such as illness, fasting, dehydration, menstruation, stress, strenuous exercise, or lack of sleep. The low level of the bilirubin-processing enzyme that causes Gilbert's syndrome may also increase the side effects of certain medications, and having any other condition that impairs the destruction of red blood cells may increase the risk of developing gallstones. Symptoms of Gilbert syndrome include an occasional yellowish tinge of the skin and the whites of the eyes due to slightly elevated bilirubin levels in the blood.\n\nGilbert syndrome is a common disorder that affects many people, and it can be diagnosed through a series of tests, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a direct bilirubin test. Treatment for Gilbert syndrome typically involves monitoring the condition and providing supportive care to manage symptoms. In some cases, medications may be prescribed to help break down bilirubin in the liver. It is important for individuals with Gilbert syndrome to avoid certain medications that can exacerbate the condition, such as irinotecan and certain protease inhibitors used to treat HIV.

  "Gilbert Syndrome": "Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, resulting in harmless intermittent jaundice. The condition is caused by an abnormal gene that controls the production of an enzyme involved in bilirubin breakdown in the liver. This enzyme deficiency leads to excess bilirubin in the blood, which may increase and cause jaundice, especially during periods of illness, fasting, dehydration, menstruation, stress, or lack of sleep. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment produced when red blood cells are broken down in the body. The liver normally breaks it down and excretes it into the bile, but in Gilbert syndrome, the enzyme activity is reduced, leading to accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.\n\nThe symptoms of Gilbert syndrome can be mild and may not always appear, but when they do, they include an occasional yellowish tinge of the skin and whites of the eyes due to slightly elevated bilirubin levels in the blood. The condition is more common in males than females, and both parents must carry the abnormal gene for their child to inherit it. Although Gilbert syndrome usually doesn't cause any problems, there are some potential complications associated with it. For example, the low level of the bilirubin-processing enzyme may also increase the side effects of certain medications, such as irinotecan and some protease inhibitors used to treat HIV. Additionally, having Gilbert syndrome may increase the risk of developing gallstones.\n\nIf you experience jaundice or any other symptoms associated with Gilbert syndrome, it's essential to see a doctor for proper evaluation and treatment. A diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome is made based on a combination of clinical findings, family history, and laboratory tests.

  "Methylmalonic aciduria due to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency": "Vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia is an inborn error of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism characterized by recurrent ketoacidotic crises or transient vomiting, dehydration, hypotonia and intellectual deficit, which does not respond to administration of vitamin B12. There are two types of vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia: mut0 and mut-, each with distinct clinical and molecular features.\n\nPatients with vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia without homocystinuria typically present very early in life (<1 to 4 weeks) with features including lethargy, failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, dehydration, respiratory distress, muscular hypotonia, hepatomegaly and coma. Later-onset manifestations may include developmental delay and intellectual deficit. Patients may also show signs of anemia which is not megaloblastic. They may also have potentially life-threatening ketoacidosis and/or hyperammonemia, renal and neurological complications, metabolic stroke and cardiomyopathy. Later-onset and milder phenotypes have also been observed, particularly in mut- patients. Long term consequences are neurological damage due to metabolic stroke and end-stage renal failure. These complications are more frequent in mut0 than in mut-.\n\nManagement and treatment involve a protein-restricted diet, which should be instituted as soon as life-threatening problems such as ketoacidosis or hyperammonemia have been resolved. Oral antibiotics may also be useful. Liver transplantation has been attempted in a limited number of patients but this does not usually offer complete protection against renal and neurological complications. Early detection and aggressive management can significantly improve outcomes for these patients. Prognosis is poor if left untreated, with high risk of death or significant disability due to the progressive nature of the disease.\n\nEpidemiology: The prevalence of methylmalonic aciduria varies depending on the population studied, with an estimated incidence of 1/48000-1/61000 in North America and 1/26000 in China. However, only a subset of this is vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia.\n\nEtiology: Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency is caused by mutations in the MUT gene, which encodes the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, mitochondrial. This enzyme plays a critical role in the metabolism of cobalamin (vitamin B12) and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in the body.\n\nInheritance: Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition.\n\nDIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria due to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency is based on a combination of clinical features, laboratory tests and molecular genetic analysis. Laboratory tests may include measurement of methylmalonic acid levels in blood or urine, as well as assessment of vitamin B12 status and cobalamin absorption. Molecular genetic analysis can confirm the presence of a mutation in the MUT gene.\n\nPROGNOSIS: The prognosis for patients with methylmalonic aciduria due to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency is poor if left untreated, with high risk of death or significant disability due to the progressive nature of the disease. Early detection and aggressive management can significantly improve outcomes for these patients.",

The disease typically presents with prominent frontoparietal bones, a high forehead with ridging of the metopic and sagittal sutures, lateral frontal prominences, and facial dysmorphism such as a flat nasal root and short, upturned nose. Other features may include coarse, brittle hair, small ears, and delayed neurological development. The disorder is X-linked, meaning the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome, and typically affects males more severely than females due to the X-inactivation phenomenon. The exact prevalence of the disease is unknown, but it is estimated to be less than 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide.\n\nThe clinical presentation of X-linked calvarial hyperostosis varies widely among affected individuals, with some displaying mild symptoms while others experience more severe manifestations. Common symptoms include headaches, double vision, and difficulty with balance and coordination. In some cases, the increased intracranial pressure can lead to encephalopathy, which can result in cognitive impairment and developmental delays.\n\nThe etiology of X-linked calvarial hyperostosis is attributed to mutations in the FGFR1 gene, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of bone growth and development. These mutations lead to an overproduction of bone tissue in the skull, resulting in the characteristic thickening and hardening of the calvarium. The exact mechanisms by which these mutations disrupt normal bone development and function are not yet fully understood.\n\nThere is currently no cure for X-linked calvarial hyperostosis, and treatment is primarily focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Medications such as analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to alleviate headaches and reduce inflammation, while physical therapy and occupational therapy can help improve balance and coordination. In some cases, surgical interventions such as craniectomy or bone grafting may be necessary to relieve pressure on the brain and correct facial abnormalities.\n\nIn conclusion, X-linked calvarial hyperostosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density in the skull, particularly in the calvarium. The disease typically presents with distinctive craniofacial features and can lead to a range of cognitive, neurological, and physical symptoms.

  "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency due to DNA-PKcs Deficiency": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to DNA-PKcs deficiency is a rare and severe genetic disorder characterized by a complete or near-complete absence of T and B lymphocytes, which are crucial for the immune system's defense against infections. This condition is caused by mutations in the DNA-PKcs gene, which leads to a deficiency in the enzyme DNA-PKcs, essential for V(D)J recombination, a critical process in T and B cell development. The absence of these cells renders the individual highly susceptible to infections, including opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, which can cause life-threatening pneumonia.\n\nThe clinical presentation of SCID due to DNA-PKcs deficiency typically includes severe and recurrent infections, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and delayed growth and development. These symptoms usually become apparent within the first few months of life, and the disease can progress rapidly if left untreated. The lack of T and B cells also makes the individual more sensitive to ionizing radiation, which can increase the risk of developing cancer.\n\nThe prevalence of SCID due to DNA-PKcs deficiency is extremely rare, affecting fewer than 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide. The exact incidence is unknown, as this condition is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. However, it is believed that the majority of SCID cases are due to genetic mutations, with the DNA-PKcs gene being one of the most commonly affected genes.\n\nManagement of SCID due to DNA-PKcs deficiency involves a combination of immunological and supportive care. Bone marrow transplantation is the primary treatment, as it can restore T and B cell function and prevent further immune system deterioration.

  "Metabolic myopathy due to lactate transporter defect": "Metabolic myopathy due to lactate transporter defect is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle cramping and/or stiffness after exercise (especially during heat exposure), post-exertional rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria, and elevation of serum creatine kinase. The condition is caused by mutations in the slc16a1 gene, which codes for the lactate transporter protein. This protein plays a critical role in the transport of lactate across the muscle cell membrane, allowing lactate to be metabolized and producing energy for the muscle. When the lactate transporter is deficient or dysfunctional, lactate builds up in the muscles, leading to muscle damage and the symptoms associated with this condition.\n\nThe clinical presentation of metabolic myopathy due to lactate transporter defect typically begins in early childhood or adolescence, with progressive muscle weakness and cramping occurring after exercise. In severe cases, post-exertional rhabdomyolysis can occur, resulting in the breakdown of muscle tissue and the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. This can lead to myoglobinuria, a condition characterized by the presence of myoglobin in the urine. Elevated levels of serum creatine kinase are also common in this condition, as the enzyme is released from damaged muscle fibers.\n\nThe exact prevalence of metabolic myopathy due to lactate transporter defect is not well established, as it is a rare disorder and there is limited research on the topic. However, it is believed to be a relatively rare condition, affecting perhaps 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 500,000 individuals worldwide. The disorder can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\nManagement of metabolic myopathy due to lactate transporter defect typically involves a combination of physical therapy and medication. Physical therapy can help improve muscle strength and function, while medications such as corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation and prevent further muscle damage. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary to manage symptoms and prevent complications.\n\nIn conclusion, metabolic myopathy due to lactate transporter defect is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle cramping and/or stiffness after exercise, post-exertional rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria, and elevation of serum creatine kinase.

  "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type (HT-EDS)": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type (HT-EDS) is the most frequent form of EDS, a group of hereditary connective tissue diseases. It is characterized by joint hyperlaxity, mild skin hyperextensibility, tissue fragility, and extra-musculoskeletal manifestations. The most common clinical features include hyperextensible skin and joints, skin fragility and reduced wound healing capability. People with HT-EDS may also experience vascular complications such as weakening of the heart's largest artery, as well as the arteries to other regions of the body, which can result in fatal ruptures. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines, leading to rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus. HT-EDS is caused by defects in the synthesis or structure of fibrillar collagen, and there are numerous subtypes, including classical, hypermobility, vascular, and others. The inheritance pattern of HT-EDS varies, with a 50% chance of passing on the gene to each child if you have the most common form. Genetic counseling can help individuals understand the risks of inherited disorders and make informed decisions about starting a family.\n\nIn summary, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type is a heterogeneous group of autosomally inherited collagen diseases characterized by joint hyperlaxity, skin hyperextensibility, tissue fragility, and extra-musculoskeletal manifestations. The vascular type can result in fatal ruptures of major blood vessels, and pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus. Understanding the inheritance pattern and risks of HT-EDS is crucial for individuals who are thinking about starting a family to make informed decisions with the help of genetic counseling.",

  "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD)": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset progressive myopathy characterized by progressive eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, and proximal limb weakness. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene for poly-binding protein II, which is located on chromosome 17q21. OPMD occurs worldwide with varying prevalence rates, with an estimated prevalence rate of 1-9/100000 in the general population. The highest prevalence rate of 1/1000 is found in French Canadians in Quebec and 1/600 in Israel's Bukharan Jews.\n\nThe clinical presentation of OPMD usually begins in the fifth to sixth decade of life, with early signs including ptosis, ophthalmoplegia without diplopia, limb weakness, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Symptoms usually begin after the age of 45 years, and ptosis is the most common presenting feature. Other signs that occur as the disease progresses include tongue weakness and atrophy, proximal upper and lower extremity weakness, dysphonia, dysarthria, facial muscle weakness, and limitation of upward gaze. In several cases, limb weakness has preceded dysphagia. In 5-10% of patients, the disease is more severe, with ptosis and dysphagia presenting before the age of 45 and incapacitating distal leg weakness occurring before the age of 60.\n\nThere is currently no pharmacological treatment available for OPMD, but surgical treatments can help manage symptoms. A blepharoplasty can treat ptosis when the eyelids cover more than 50% of the pupils or when neck pain is present. A cricopharyngeal myotomy or botulinum toxin injection of the cricopharyngeal muscle can be performed to achieve normal swallowing, but dysphagia usually recurs years after surgery. The intake of dietary supplements and a diet of foods that are soft and easy to swallow are often necessary. Some patients may need a wheelchair if muscle atrophy is severe.\n\nThe main sign of muscular dystrophy is progressive muscle weakness, and specific signs and symptoms begin at different ages and in different muscle groups depending on the type of muscular dystrophy. The diagnosis of OPMD is based on a combination of clinical findings, genetic testing, and muscle biopsy.

BFPP specifically affects the frontoparietal region of the brain, resulting in a range of clinical manifestations. Infants with BFPP typically present with hypotonia, developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, pyramidal signs, epileptic seizures, non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysconjugate gaze and/or strabismus. The malformation is caused by abnormalities in the genes involved in brain development, leading to an imbalance in the growth and migration of neural progenitor cells during fetal life.\n\nBFPP is a rare disease, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 births worldwide. The exact cause of BFPP is unknown, but genetic mutations have been identified as the primary risk factor for developing the disorder. Inheritance patterns suggest that BFPP may be an autosomal dominant disorder, with some reports suggesting that the disease can skip generations or exhibit incomplete penetrance.\n\nClinically, BFPP is characterized by a combination of neurological and developmental symptoms. Infants with BFPP often have delayed motor skills, including hypotonia and poor muscle tone, which can result in developmental delays and intellectual disability. Pyramidal signs, such as spasticity and hyperreflexia, are also common, and may be accompanied by seizures. Non-progressive cerebellar ataxia and dysconjugate gaze and/or strabismus are other notable features of BFPP.\n\nManagement of BFPP typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including medical, educational, and psychological interventions. Medications may be prescribed to manage seizures and hypertonicity, while physical therapy and occupational therapy can help improve motor skills and coordination. Educational support and psychological counseling can also play an important role in managing the social and emotional challenges associated with BFPP.

  "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Nystagmus (BPPV)": "Benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (BPPV) is an inner ear disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. The condition is also known as idiopathic recurrent vertigo associated with positional nystagmus, and it is defined by the absence of inflammation in the ear despite vestibular loss. BPPV primarily affects older adults and is estimated to impact approximately 1 in 100 individuals worldwide.\n\nThe primary symptom of BPPV is a sudden, brief episode of vertigo triggered by changes in head position, such as rolling over in bed or standing up too quickly. This episode is often accompanied by nystagmus, or uncontrolled eye movements, that occur in the direction of the affected ear. The nystagmus can be observed in the horizontal plane and may also occur during other positions, such as bending or sitting.\n\nThe exact cause of BPPV remains unknown, but it is believed to result from a problem with the inner ear's vestibular system. This system is responsible for maintaining balance and orientation by detecting changes in head position and movement. It is thought that the vestibular system becomes irritated or inflamed in individuals with BPPV, leading to an abnormal response to head movements.\n\nThe diagnosis of BPPV typically involves a comprehensive medical history and physical examination, including a series of maneuvers designed to elicit the characteristic nystagmus. These maneuvers may include the Epley maneuver, which involves moving the patient's head in specific ways to reproduce the symptoms. Additional tests, such as imaging studies or vestibular function tests, may also be performed to rule out other potential causes of vertigo.\n\nThere is no cure for BPPV, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms. The most effective treatment is the Epley maneuver, which involves repositioning the patient's head in a specific way to move the vestibular system and relieve the irritation or inflammation. This maneuver can be performed by a healthcare professional or, with proper training, by the patient themselves. Other treatments may include medications to manage symptoms such as nausea and dizziness, as well as physical therapy exercises to improve balance and reduce the risk of falls.\n\nIn summary, benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (BPPV) is an inner ear disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo triggered by head position changes.

  "benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus": "Name: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Nystagmus (BPPV)\n\nDescription: Benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (BPPV) is a benign and recurrent vestibular disorder characterized by brief, repeated episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. The condition is caused by an abnormality in the inner ear, specifically in the utricle, which is responsible for balance and equilibrium. BPPV is associated with idiopathic vestibular loss without any other neurological or auditory signs, excluding inflammation in the ear. Despite its name, BPPV can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, as it can cause frequent episodes of vertigo that can last from several seconds to several minutes. These episodes can occur at any time and can be triggered by simple head movements such as turning in bed or standing up.\n\nThe clinical presentation of BPPV typically involves sudden episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The nystagmus associated with BPPV is positional, meaning that it occurs only when the individual's head is moved in a specific direction. The nystagmus can be observed in all directions, including up and down, left and right, and rotational movements. In some cases, BPPV can also cause a feeling of unsteadiness or lightheadedness, especially during episodes of vertigo.\n\nThe exact cause of BPPV is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to an abnormality in the inner ear's vestibular system. This system is responsible for maintaining balance and equilibrium, and any disruption can lead to symptoms of vertigo. Some research suggests that BPPV may be associated with changes in the inner ear's fluid levels or structure, while other studies point to potential abnormalities in the auditory nerve or brainstem.\n\nThe diagnosis of BPPV typically involves a thorough medical history and physical examination, along with specialized tests such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. This maneuver involves rapid head movements designed to trigger the symptoms of BPPV, allowing healthcare providers to observe the nystagmus and determine the direction of the abnormal movement. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI scans, may also be ordered to rule out other potential causes of vertigo.\n\nTreatment for BPPV typically involves a combination of physical therapy and medication. Canalith repositioning procedures, such as the Epley maneuver, can help to move the crystals in the inner ear back into their normal position, alleviating symptoms. Medications such as benzodiazepines or antihistamines may also be prescribed to help manage symptoms of vertigo and nausea. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat BPPV, particularly if other treatments are unsuccessful.\n\nIn conclusion, benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (BPPV) is a common vestibular disorder characterized by brief, recurrent episodes of vertigo triggered by head position changes. While the exact cause of BPPV is not fully understood, it is believed to be related to an abnormality in the inner ear's vestibular system.

  "Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency (FGD)": "Familial glucocorticoid deficiency, also known as FGD, is a rare group of primary adrenal insufficiencies characterized by neonatal hyperpigmentation, hypoglycemia, failure to thrive, and recurrent infections. Biochemically, the condition is defined by glucocorticoid deficiency without mineralocorticoid deficiency. The clinical presentation typically occurs in infancy or early childhood, with symptoms including hyperpigmentation of the skin and gums, hypoglycemic seizures, and failure to thrive. Recurrent infections are also common, often being the presenting sign in older children. In addition to these symptoms, patients may experience weakness, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, flank or abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea due to hypocortisolemia. If left untreated, hypoglycemic crises can lead to coma or death, while recurrent hypoglycemia may result in neurological sequelae such as learning disabilities, intellectual deficit, and severe sensory and motor defects. Tall stature has been reported in some patients with FGD, particularly those with MC2R gene defects. The prevalence of FGD is unknown, although it is estimated to be around 1/200,000 in Ireland, with a higher prevalence observed in the Irish Traveler sub-population. Management consists of lifelong replacement therapy with oral hydrocortisone, with dose modification necessary during stresses such as surgery or intercurrent illness. Patients should also carry injectable hydrocortisone for emergencies and have a medical alert type bracelet or card. Prompt treatment of hypoglycemic crises is essential to prevent complications.",
  "Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features": "Autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by partial seizures originating in the temporal lobe, often accompanied by prominent ictal auditory symptoms and/or receptive aphasia. Typically presenting in adolescence or early adulthood, ADEAF typically begins with focal epilepsy originating predominantly in the lateral temporal lobe, which may be precipitated by specific sounds but lacks recognizable triggers in most cases. Ictal manifestations include auditory symptoms such as humming, buzzing, ringing, and less frequently, more complex sounds like voices, songs, or volume changes, as well as receptive aphasia. Rarely, additional ictal manifestations, such as other sensory symptoms, motor, psychic, and autonomic symptoms, may be reported. Disease course is usually benign with patients often being seizure-free following treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Evaluation of relatives is crucial to identify those at risk and benefit from early treatment initiation and/or measures to reduce the risk of seizure onset. While ADEAF can occur at any age, the prevalence is unknown but likely very low, with fewer than 3% of individuals with epilepsy having a significant family history of the condition. Treatment typically involves antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate, which often result in seizure control.",
  "Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features (ADEAF)": "Autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF) is a rare, genetic, familial partial epilepsy disorder characterized by focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe and often accompanied by prominent ictal auditory symptoms. The condition typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood, although it can occur at any age between 4-50 years old. Seizures may be triggered by specific sounds, such as telephone ringing or speech, but most cases have no recognizable triggers. Ictal manifestations include auditory symptoms like humming, buzzing, ringing, and less frequently, more complex sounds like voices, songs, or volume changes, as well as receptive aphasia. Rarely, additional ictal manifestations may occur, including other sensory symptoms, motor, psychic, and autonomic symptoms. The disease course is usually benign, with patients often becoming seizure-free following treatment with anti-seizure medications. ADEAF is treated with antiepileptic drugs commonly used in clinical practice, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate, with seizure control achieved in the majority of cases.

  "Distal Myopathy with Anterior Tibial Onset": "Distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by a progressive muscle weakness that initiates in the anterior tibial muscles before extending to lower and upper limb muscles. Clinically, patients present with an insidious onset of symptoms, often beginning with subtle distal muscle wasting and weakness, particularly affecting ambulation. As the disease progresses, muscular atrophy and loss of motor function lead to significant mobility impairment, ultimately resulting in wheelchair dependence. Laboratory investigations typically reveal elevated serum creatine kinase levels, reflecting myocyte damage, whereas muscle biopsy analysis discloses the absence of dysferlin, a key protein involved in membrane repair and maintenance. The underlying molecular mechanism is attributed to homozygous mutations within the gene encoding dysferlin on chromosome 2p13. Distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset has an extremely low prevalence, affecting fewer than one in one million individuals, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and management to optimize patient outcomes.",
  "Congenital Cataract-Progressive Muscular Hypotonia-Hearing Loss-Developmental Delay Syndrome (CPMHHDD)": "Congenital Cataract-Progressive Muscular Hypotonia-Hearing Loss-Developmental Delay Syndrome is a rare, genetic, mitochondrial myopathy disorder characterized by congenital cataract, progressive muscular hypotonia that particularly affects the lower limbs, reduced deep tendon reflexes, sensorineural hearing loss, global developmental delay, and lactic acidosis. The condition often presents with symptoms of hearing loss, including muffled speech and sounds, difficulty understanding words, especially in noisy environments or crowds, trouble hearing consonants, frequently asking others to speak more slowly and clearly, and withdrawal from conversations due to auditory difficulties. A thorough examination typically reveals reduced complex I, II, and IV respiratory chain activity on muscle biopsy. Prevalence is less than 1 in 100,000. The condition can have significant effects on quality of life, including depression, isolation, cognitive impairment, and decline. Early diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent further deterioration and optimize outcomes. Treatment typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating ophthalmological, audiological, neurodevelopmental, and genetic assessments, as well as ongoing care and support for affected individuals.",
  "Familial Long QT Syndrome": "Familial long QT syndrome is a hereditary cardiac disease characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval at basal electrocardiography (ECG) and a high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. This condition is caused by abnormalities in the heart's electrical recharging system, resulting in a delay in the heart's ability to recharge between beats, known as a prolonged QT interval. The disease can be grouped into two main categories: congenital long QT syndrome, which is present from birth and often caused by genetic mutations, and acquired long QT syndrome, which is caused by underlying medical conditions or medications that lengthen the QT interval. Congenital long QT syndrome is often associated with a family history of the condition, while acquired long QT syndrome can occur in people without a family history. The most common form of congenital long QT syndrome is Romano-Ward syndrome, which has a prevalence close to 1/2500 live births. Symptoms may include syncopal episodes, T wave abnormalities on ECG, and, in some cases, seizures or sudden cardiac death. Management typically involves the use of beta-blockers, left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy as necessary. Prevention is largely focused on proper treatment and lifestyle changes to prevent complications related to long QT syndrome, such as torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death.",
  "Familial Long QT Syndrome (FLQTS)": "Familial long QT syndrome (FLQTS) is a hereditary cardiac disease characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval at basal ECG and a high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. This condition is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, which encodes a protein in the voltage-gated potassium channel. The clinical presentation typically includes syncopal episodes and electrocardiographic abnormalities such as QT prolongation, T-wave abnormalities, and torsade de pointes (TdP) ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac events can occur from infancy through middle age, but may manifest as early as the intrauterine stage with a possibility of stillbirth. Symptoms rarely occur at rest or during sleep, but rather are triggered by exercise, stress, or emotional disturbances. The electrocardiogram typically shows a prolongation of ventricular repolarization (QTc > 460 ms) and biphasic or notched T-waves in the precordial leads.\n\nThe prevalence of FLQTS is estimated at 1-5 per 10,000. Management and treatment options include beta-adrenergic blockers as first-line therapy for symptomatic patients, with left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) considered when syncopal episodes recur despite full-dose beta-blocking therapy. Cardiac pacing is rarely indicated, except in infants or young children with 2:1 atrioventricular block. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are always indicated after cardiac arrest, or when requested by the patient, and whenever syncope recurs despite beta-blockade and LCSD. Prophylactic use of beta blockers is indicated in asymptomatic children and adults under age 40 years with LQTS.\n\nFLQTS can be congenital or acquired, with more than 17 genes linked to the condition so far. Acquired long QT syndrome can be caused by medications, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying medical conditions. Risk factors for developing FLQTS include a history of cardiac arrest, having a first-degree relative with the condition, using medications known to cause prolonged QT intervals, and being female and on heart medication. Complications of FLQTS include torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, sudden death, unexplained fainting, drownings, seizures, or other accidents.\n\nPrevention strategies for congenital FLQTS are limited, but with proper treatment, patients can prevent the dangerous heartbeats that can lead to complications. Patients may be able to prevent health conditions that lead to some types of acquired FLQTS by maintaining regular health checkups and good communication with their doctor. It is especially important to avoid medications that can affect heart rhythm and cause prolongation of the QT interval. When to seek medical attention includes sudden fainting during physical activity or emotional excitement, after taking any new medication, or having a first-degree relative with FLQTS.",
  "Congenital Factor II Deficiency": "Congenital factor II deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder characterized by reduced activity of prothrombin, leading to mucocutaneous and soft tissue bleeding symptoms. This extremely rare condition affects both sexes equally and has an estimated prevalence of less than 1 in 1 million individuals, with homozygous forms occurring at a frequency of approximately 1 in 2 million people. The clinical presentation can manifest at any age, ranging from mild to severe forms, often featuring epistaxis, menorrhagia, oral cavity bleedings, mucosal bleeding, soft tissue bleeding, hemarthrosis, easy bruising, and prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction, trauma or surgery. In rare instances, severe forms may present with intracranial hemorrhage. The severity of bleeding manifestations correlates directly with the levels of prothrombin activity, while dysprothrombinemia has been associated with thromboembolic complications. Management typically involves the administration of Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs) or fresh frozen plasma when PCCs are unavailable to treat hemorrhagic episodes and prevent further bleeding complications.",
  "Congenital Prothrombin Deficiency": "Congenital prothrombin deficiency, also known as congenital factor II deficiency, is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by reduced activity of factor II (FII), also referred to as prothrombin.

  "Stiff-person Syndrome": "Stiff-person syndrome (SMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by fluctuating trunk and limb stiffness, painful muscle spasms, task-specific phobia, an exaggerated startle response, and ankylosing deformities such as fixed lumbar hyperlordosis. Typically affecting individuals in the fourth to sixth decade of life, SMS presents with intermittent spasms that may become continuous over time. Minor sensory stimuli, including noise and light touch, can precipitate severe spasms, which do not occur during sleep and rarely involve cranial muscles. Respiratory impairment may ensue in advanced cases. The disorder is often accompanied by a specific fear of crossing open spaces (pseudo-agoraphobia), inducing freezing of gait, sudden spasms, and falls. Clinical variants include the stiff limb syndrome (SLS) and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). Notably, many patients with SMS, SLS, or PERM have underlying autoimmune disorders such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, atrophic gastritis with pernicious anaemia, or tumours of the breast, lung, or colon. While benzodiazepines and baclofen are standard treatments for symptomatic relief, immunomodulating therapies have been proposed but yield variable results. SMS and SLS respond well to treatment, whereas PERM may be more challenging to manage and potentially has a poor prognosis.",
  "Stiff-Person Syndrome": "Stiff-person syndrome (SMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by fluctuating trunk and limb stiffness, painful muscle spasms, task-specific phobia, an exaggerated startle response, and ankylosing deformities such as fixed lumbar hyperlordosis. Typically affecting the axial muscles, SMS progresses to involve proximal limb muscles, often leading to muscle damage and fractures due to spontaneous or reflex-induced muscle spasms. Clinical presentation is marked by age of onset peaking around 45, with symptoms developing over months or years. Progressive muscle stiffness renders the trunk and hips immobile, while superimposed painful muscle spasms may induce freezing of gait, sudden spasms, and falls. A specific fear of crossing open spaces (pseudo-agoraphobia) can further exacerbate symptoms. Focal neurological signs are absent in SMS, although clinical variants such as stiff limb syndrome (SLS) and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) may present with focal findings. Notably, many patients with SMS, SLS, or PERM exhibit comorbidities including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, atrophic gastritis with pernicious anaemia, and tumours of the breast, lung, or colon. Management typically involves benzodiazepines and baclofen for symptomatic treatment, while immunomodulating therapies have been proposed with varying degrees of success. Although SMS and SLS generally respond well to treatment, PERM tends to be more challenging to control and may portend a poor prognosis.",
  "Congenital Muscular Dystrophy without Intellectual Disability": "Congenital muscular dystrophy without intellectual disability is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by a wide phenotypic spectrum. This condition presents with hypotonia and muscular weakness evident at birth or early infancy, often accompanied by delayed or arrested motor development. Notably, affected individuals typically exhibit normal intellectual abilities with normal or only mild abnormalities on neuroimaging studies. Feeding difficulties, joint and spinal deformities, and respiratory insufficiency may also be associated features. The disease is characterized by decreased alpha-dystroglycan on immunohistochemical muscle staining and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. As the condition progresses, patients may experience decreased mobility, contractures, breathing problems, curved spine, heart problems, swallowing difficulties, and other complications. Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and genetic analysis. Early recognition and management are crucial to mitigate the impact of this debilitating condition on affected individuals and their families.",
  "VIPoma": "VIPoma is an extremely rare type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), leading to the characteristic manifestations of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria. This syndrome, also known as WDHA syndrome, typically presents in patients over the age of 50, with a slight female predominance. The median age at diagnosis is the fifth decade of life, although VIPoma can occur at any age. Common clinical features include chronic watery diarrhea exceeding 3 liters per day, odorless and unaffected by fasting, as well as hypokalemia manifesting as muscle weakness, abdominal cramps, or respiratory depression. Additionally, patients often experience various dietary deficiencies due to achlorhydria/hypochlorhydia, such as iron and B12 deficiency. Less common manifestations include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, bloating, indigestion, skin rash, facial flushing, backache, and lethargy. In approximately 60-80% of cases, metastasis has occurred at the time of diagnosis, most commonly to the liver, but also to lung, lymph nodes, and kidney. If left untreated, prolonged dehydration can lead to renal failure and cardiac arrest. Non-functional VIPomas are rare. Initial management focuses on replacing fluid losses, restoring electrolyte levels, and reversing acidosis, often requiring hospitalization for intravenous fluids and potassium replacement. Octreotide has been shown to be effective in controlling diarrhea and reducing VIP hormone levels, while loperamide may also be employed. Surgical resection is the standard treatment for primary or metastatic VIPoma, with unresectable metastatic disease occasionally treated with chemotherapy using a docorubicin/streptozocin regimen.",
  "Familial Gestational Hyperthyroidism": "Familial gestational hyperthyroidism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, accompanied by severe symptoms such as hyperemesis gravidarum. This condition arises from hypersensitivity of the thyrotropin receptor to chorionic gonadotropin, despite normal serum levels of this hormone. The clinical presentation typically includes severe nausea and vomiting, leading to weight loss, as well as tachycardia, excessive sweating, and hand tremors. Notably, ophthalmopathy is not a feature of this condition. Epidemiological studies suggest that familial gestational hyperthyroidism is an extremely rare disorder, with only sporadic cases reported in the literature. Management typically involves antithyroid medication to control symptoms, as well as supportive care to alleviate nausea and vomiting. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the thyroid gland if medical management is ineffective or contraindicated. Due to its rarity, there is limited understanding of this condition's natural history and long-term outcomes; therefore, further research is needed to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",
  "Congenital Tricuspid Stenosis": "Congenital tricuspid stenosis is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by narrowing of the tricuspid valve orifice, resulting from anomalies such as incompletely developed leaflets, shortened and malformed chordae tendineae, small annulus, and/or abnormal number and size of papillary muscles. This obstruction to right ventricular inflow can present clinically with a spectrum of symptoms depending on its severity and the presence or absence of additional cardiac anomalies. Mild cases may be asymptomatic, while more significant stenosis can manifest as easy fatigability, swelling of the lower limbs, hepatomegaly, and other signs of right-sided heart failure. The diagnosis is typically made through echocardiography, with confirmatory imaging studies such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging used to establish the extent of the anomaly. Management often involves medical therapy to manage symptoms and prevent complications, with surgical intervention sometimes necessary to palliate or correct the defect. In some cases, cardiac transplantation may be required for patients who develop end-stage heart failure.",
  "Idiopathic Aplastic Anemia": "Idiopathic aplastic anemia is a rare and life-threatening condition characterized by the premature destruction of bone marrow, leading to a severe deficiency in red blood cells. This autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly targets and destroys its own stem cells, thereby disrupting the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The exact causes of idiopathic aplastic anemia are unknown, although it is often associated with infections, certain medications, and environmental toxins. The clinical presentation typically includes symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale or yellowish skin, irregular heartbeats, shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, chest pain, cold hands and feet, and headaches, which worsen as anemia progresses. If left untreated, idiopathic aplastic anemia can lead to severe complications, including fatigue, pregnancy complications, heart problems, and even death. The prevalence of this condition is estimated to be 1-9 per million people, with a higher incidence in individuals over the age of 65. While there is no known cure for idiopathic aplastic anemia, management typically involves blood transfusions, immunosuppressive therapy, and supportive care to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.

This inherited condition affects approximately 1-2% of the Caucasian population, with only a minority of carriers developing symptoms. The majority of patients present with post-exercise symptoms, including rapid fatigue, cramps, and myalgias, which can occur at any age from childhood to adulthood. While there is no evidence of muscular dystrophy or wasting, the disorder exclusively affects skeletal muscle, sparing smooth muscle and other organs. Unfortunately, there is no medical cure for this condition; however, administration of D-ribose has been shown to provide short-term symptom relief, although its effects are not sustained over subsequent days. The clinical course usually stabilises after a few years, with patients often requiring ongoing management to mitigate the impact of symptoms on daily life.",
  "Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy": "Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetic form of heart disease characterized by the thinning and weakening of cardiac muscle in at least one chamber of the heart, resulting in dilation and contractile dysfunction. This condition often presents with signs and symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmias, including fatigue, shortness of breath, reduced exercise tolerance, swelling, chest pain, and abnormal sounds heard when the heart beats. The etiology of familial dilated cardiomyopathy is often idiopathic; however, various factors can contribute to its development, such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, alcohol abuse, certain cancer medications, infections, toxins, arrhythmias, and complications of late-stage pregnancy. Risk factors include damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack, family history of dilated cardiomyopathy, inflammation of heart muscle from immune system disorders, neuromuscular disorders, and age (commonly affecting men between 20-50 years). Complications can arise, including heart failure, heart valve regurgitation, fluid buildup, abnormal heart rhythms, sudden cardiac arrest, blood clots, and arrhythmias. Prevention involves maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, avoiding cocaine use, eating a low-salt diet, maintaining a healthy weight, following an exercise regimen, and getting enough sleep and rest. Early detection through genetic testing can benefit individuals with inherited forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, allowing for timely interventions to prevent or minimize the effects of this condition.",
  "aorta coarctation": "Aorta coarctation is a congenital cardiovascular anomaly characterized by the narrowing of a segment of the aorta, which can occur at any point from the transverse arch to the iliac bifurcation. The narrowed portion causes arterial hypertension proximal to the site and arterial hypotension distal to it. Clinical presentation often includes hypertension, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, headaches, and leg cramps. Patients may also exhibit signs of cardiovascular compromise, such as fatigue, dyspnea, and chest pain. In some cases, patients may remain asymptomatic until adulthood when the condition can precipitate cardiac complications, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and aortic dissection. The prevalence of aorta coarctation varies depending on the population studied, but it is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in every 50,000 live births. Management typically involves surgical repair or endovascular stenting, which can help alleviate symptoms, prevent long-term complications, and improve overall cardiovascular health.",
  "Aorta Coarctation": "Aorta coarctation is a congenital anomaly characterized by a narrowing of the aortic segment, typically located just distal to the left subclavian artery. This condition often presents with hypertension in the upper body, resulting from increased pressure exerted on the circulatory system.

Onset may be spontaneous in some patients, whereas others experience manifestations shortly after the stimulus. The disease persists for 6 months to years, often accompanied by anxiety, fatigue, and impaired cognition. Symptoms are frequently exacerbated when in an enclosed space or attempting to remain motionless (sitting, lying down, or standing still), but tend to subside when in passive motion, such as during a moving car, airplane, or train ride.",
  "Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)": "Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is an idiopathic motor neuron disease characterized by slowly progressive upper motor neuron dysfunction, leading to spasticity, mild weakness in voluntary muscle movement, hyperreflexia, and loss of motor speech production. This neurodegenerative disorder typically affects adult individuals, although a rare juvenile form exists. PLS is not familial, and its cause remains unknown for the adult-onset variant, whereas genetic mutations in the ALS2 gene are responsible for the juvenile form. The disease progresses slowly over years, with symptoms initially manifesting in the legs, often starting in one leg, and gradually affecting the trunk, arms, hands, tongue, and jaw. As the disease advances, patients may experience hoarseness, slowed and slurred speech, drooling, difficulties with swallowing, and potentially respiratory compromise. While the average progression of PLS lasts around 20 years, its effects are highly variable, and some individuals may eventually require assistive devices or wheelchairs to maintain mobility. Adult-onset PLS is not typically associated with a shortened life expectancy, but it can significantly impact quality of life as more muscles become disabled, increasing the risk of falls and injuries. Prompt medical attention is essential for diagnosis and management, particularly when persistent problems with stiffness, weakness, swallowing, or speaking arise.",
  "Kelley-Seegmiller Syndrome": "Kelley-Seegmiller Syndrome, also known as hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase partial deficiency, is a hereditary disorder of purine metabolism characterized by uric acid overproduction leading to urolithiasis and early-onset gout. Typically affecting males, with heterozygous females acting as carriers, this condition usually presents in infancy or early adulthood with the appearance of orange crystals in diapers, followed by symptoms such as urolithiasis, uric acid nephropathy, urinary infections, and renal obstruction. Gout may emerge after puberty, often accompanied by acute arthritis or tophi. Notably, dystonia is generally mild or absent, unlike Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which distinguishes KSS from other HPRT deficiencies. Patients typically exhibit normal intelligence alongside varying degrees of attention deficit, but compulsive self-injurious behavior is absent. Management and treatment involve managing uric acid overproduction, nephrolithiasis, gouty arthritis, and tophi through allopurinol, urine alkalinization, and generous hydration, with careful dosage adjustments necessary to avoid xanthine lithiasis.",
  "Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa Type 2, Classic Type": "Autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2, classic type is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive clinical presentation of premature aging features, including wrinkled and sagging skin, prominent veins, and loose, inelastic skin. The condition typically presents in early childhood, with the characteristic skin changes becoming more pronounced over time. Affected individuals often exhibit a spectrum of systemic manifestations, including joint laxity, hyperextensibility of joints, and an increased risk of premature aging-related disorders such as atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. In addition to these physical characteristics, patients may also experience cognitive impairment, growth retardation, and an increased susceptibility to infections. The disease is caused by mutations in the FBLN5 gene, which codes for fibrillin-5, a protein essential for maintaining skin elasticity and integrity. Autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2, classic type follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning that affected individuals are homozygous or compound heterozygous for the causative mutation. Diagnosis is typically made through clinical evaluation and molecular genetic testing. While there is currently no cure for this condition, management involves a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy to address joint laxity and hyperextensibility, as well as treatment of associated comorbidities such as osteoporosis and premature aging-related disorders.",
  "Hereditary Coproporphyria": "Hereditary coproporphyria is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase, resulting in neurologic damage and a range of symptoms. The disease typically manifests after puberty and preferentially affects women, with 85-95% of cases presenting as intense abdominal pain accompanied by neurological and psychological symptoms such as irritability, emotionality, depression, anxiety, hallucinations, disorientation, and mental confusion. Tachycardia and hyponatremia are common during attacks, which can be triggered by exogenous factors like porphyrinogenic drugs, alcohol, infections, or stress, or endogenous factors linked to hormonal fluctuations. In approximately 30% of cases, patients present with cutaneous lesions as a result of photosensitivity, characterized by bullae that cause pain and leave hyperpigmented scars. Urgent treatment is required for acute attacks, involving injection of human hemin and/or perfusion of carbohydrates, followed by management aimed at suppressing triggering factors, relieving symptoms, and preventing future attacks through avoidance of porphyrinogenic substances and stress reduction. Complications can include dehydration, breathing problems, seizures, high blood pressure, chronic pain, kidney failure, liver damage, and permanent skin damage. While there is no cure for hereditary coproporphyria, early detection and management can significantly improve patient outcomes.",
  "Acute Intermittent Porphyria": "Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent and life-threatening neuro-visceral attacks without cutaneous manifestations. The disease is caused by a deficiency of hydroxymethylbilane synthase, the third enzyme in the 8-enzyme biosynthetic pathway of heme, leading to elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in urine. Clinical features include recurrent neurologic disturbances, abdominal pain, and elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in urine, often triggered by exogenous or endogenous factors such as porphyrinogenic drugs, alcohol, infections, stress, hormonal changes, and menstrual cycles. Symptoms may last days to weeks and usually improve slowly after the attack. Urgent treatment with an injection of human hemin and/or perfusion of carbohydrates is required during acute attacks, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated. Management includes suppressing triggering factors, relieving pain and anxiety, and preventing attacks by avoiding triggers and using medications such as opiate analgesics. Long-term complications may include chronic pain, chronic kidney failure, liver damage, and permanent skin damage in cases of cutaneous porphyria. Genetic testing and counseling are important for family members to determine their risk of inheriting the disease. Early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent severe complications and improve patient outcomes.",
  "Hyperimmunoglobulin G1(A1) Syndrome": "Hyperimmunoglobulin G1(A1) syndrome is a rare immunodeficiency disorder characterized by elevated levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass 1, particularly the A1 subtype. Clinically, affected individuals typically present with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, often involving the lungs and sinuses, despite normal total IgG levels. The syndrome may also be accompanied by granulomatous diseases, such as sarcoidosis-like reactions, and an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, including thyroiditis and lupus. Epidemiological studies suggest that hyperimmunoglobulin G1(A1) syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder with varying modes of inheritance, including autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked patterns. Management of the disease typically involves antibiotic therapy for infections, corticosteroids to control granulomatous inflammation, and immunosuppressive agents to prevent or treat autoimmune manifestations. In some cases, bone marrow transplantation may be necessary to correct the underlying immune dysfunction. While the syndrome is rare, prompt recognition and management are crucial to improve clinical outcomes and reduce morbidity in affected individuals.",
  "Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum and Congenital Lymphedema": "Agenesis of the corpus callosum, a rare developmental disorder, is often accompanied by congenital lymphedema, characterized by swelling, heaviness, or tightness in one or more limbs. The latter arises from impaired lymphatic vessel development, leading to inadequate drainage of lymph fluid. Primary lymphedema can occur on its own, while secondary lymphedema results from damage to lymph nodes or vessels caused by various conditions, including surgery, radiation therapy, cancer, infection, and trauma. Clinical presentation typically involves chronic swelling, restricted range of motion, recurring infections, skin thickening, and aching discomfort. Patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum and congenital lymphedema may also experience cognitive and behavioral impairments due to the underlying brain malformation. Epidemiologically, this rare condition is more common in females than males, often presenting at birth or early childhood. Management involves prevention strategies, such as protecting affected limbs from injury, avoiding tight clothing, and maintaining good skin care; compression garments and physical therapy may also be employed to reduce swelling. Regular monitoring for signs of infection and lymphangiosarcoma is crucial, particularly in patients with a history of cancer treatment. When symptoms persist or worsen, prompt medical attention is necessary to prevent complications and ensure optimal quality of life.",
  "Posterior Column Ataxia": "Posterior column ataxia is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive damage to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, leading to impaired muscle coordination and balance. The primary symptom is ataxia, which can develop over time or present suddenly, manifesting as poor coordination, unsteady gait, and difficulty with fine motor tasks such as eating, writing, or buttoning a shirt. Additional signs may include involuntary back-and-forth eye movements, difficulty swallowing, and changes in speech. Causes of posterior column ataxia are diverse and can be attributed to damage, degeneration, or loss of nerve cells in the cerebellum, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. Underlying conditions that may cause ataxia include head trauma, stroke, cerebral palsy, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and sarcoidosis, infections like chickenpox and Lyme disease, paraneoplastic syndromes, abnormalities in the brain, toxic reactions to certain medications, vitamin B-6 toxicity, alcohol and drug intoxication, heavy metal poisoning, and solvent poisoning. In some cases, no specific cause can be identified, and sporadic ataxia may present as a progressive, degenerative disorder or hereditary condition. Autosomal dominant ataxias, including spinocerebellar ataxias, episodic ataxias, and Friedreich's ataxia, are characterized by poor coordination, but each has distinct signs and symptoms. Autosomal recessive ataxias, such as ataxia-telangiectasia and congenital cerebellar ataxia, are rare and typically present in childhood. Wilson's disease is another condition that can cause ataxia due to copper accumulation. When ataxia is suspected or diagnosed, prompt medical attention is necessary to rule out underlying conditions and initiate appropriate management, which may include physical therapy, medications, and lifestyle modifications.",
  "Absence Deformity of Leg-Cataract Syndrome": "Absence deformity of leg-cataract syndrome is a rare and debilitating congenital condition characterized by the absence deformity of one leg, accompanied by progressive scoliosis, short stature, and congenital cataract associated with dysplasia of the optic nerve. This syndromic limb malformation has been reported in only two cases, both occurring in unrelated boys, since its initial description in 1968. Notably, intellectual deficits have not been observed in affected individuals. Clinically, patients typically present with a notable absence deformity of one leg, often accompanied by scoliosis that worsens over time, leading to significant mobility and quality-of-life impairments. Additionally, congenital cataracts and optic nerve dysplasia contribute to visual disturbances, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary management and early intervention. With an estimated prevalence of less than 1 in 1 million, this syndrome remains a rare but important consideration for clinicians managing pediatric patients with limb malformations and ophthalmic disorders.",
  "Arteriovenous Malformations of the Brain": "Arteriovenous malformations of the brain, also known as cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), are congenital malformative communications between veins and arteries in the brain, characterized by a nidus composed of dilated and tangled supplying arterioles and drainage veins with no intervening capillary bed. These abnormalities can be asymptomatic or manifest as headaches of varying severity, generalized or focal seizures, focal neurological defects, such as weakness, numbness, speech difficulties, and vision loss, or potentially fatal intracranial hemorrhage in the event of rupture. The location and size of the AVM significantly impact clinical presentation, with symptoms varying depending on the affected region. While some AVMs may be asymptomatic, bleeding is a common complication that can cause significant neurological damage and even death if left untreated. Rarely, certain hereditary conditions, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, may increase an individual's risk of developing an AVM. Diagnosis typically occurs incidentally, following imaging studies like CT or MRI scans, often unrelated to the underlying AVM. Prompt medical attention is essential when symptoms arise, and management usually involves a multidisciplinary approach incorporating neuroimaging, interventional neuroradiology, and surgical techniques to minimize the risk of bleeding and optimize patient outcomes."
